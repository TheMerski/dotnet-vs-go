# gRPC Server Runtime Comparison

This project is designed to test the runtime differences between Go and .NET for gRPC servers. It aims to provide insights into the performance and efficiency of these two runtime environments.

## Usage

To run the gRPC server locally, you can use the [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) included in this project. The Justfile contains commands that simplify the process of starting the server. Here are the steps to run the server:

1. Start the connect gRPC server by running the `just run-connect-server` command.
1. The server should now be running locally and ready to accept incoming gRPC requests.
